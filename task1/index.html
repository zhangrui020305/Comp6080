          The Sandwich Spiral

        <div class="article">
          This is Part 2 of my Condiment Chronicles. In Part 1, I looked at how sandwiches went from the innocent joy of peanut butter and jelly to the existential dread of triple-stack monstrosities collapsing in our hands. My main takeaway was: chill. The snack industry thrives on hype, inventing fake scarcity (“limited-edition mayo”) to trick us into thinking bread plus filling is suddenly revolutionary.

          Furniture for a Tiny Moon
        </div>
        <div class="article">
          Back in 1969, people thought beanbags would solve comfort forever. The reality? Sitting in a sack of beans wasn’t nearly as utopian as advertised. If we want smaller moons colonized successfully, we’ll need modular furniture that folds into itself, preferably inflatable. Interior design is going through its own reckoning—chairs take up too much atmosphere, and tables demand gravity. The cost of bad furniture is higher than we admit.

          Chaotic Bubbles
        </div>
        <div class="article">
          When most folks imagine bubbles, they picture childhood soap wands or champagne fizz. But those are simple, predictable bubbles—short-lived, delicate, gone in seconds. True bubble potential comes when they behave unpredictably: swerving mid-air, stacking in clusters, even vibrating when poked. In my lab, I tested bubbles that reacted to sound waves and—strangely—whistled back. Turns out, there’s a whole reactive world beyond the pop.
