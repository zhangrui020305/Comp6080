          The Sandwich Spiral
        </p>

        <p class="article">
          This is Part 2 of my Condiment Chronicles. In Part 1, I looked at how sandwiches went from the innocent joy of peanut butter and jelly to the existential dread of triple-stack monstrosities collapsing in our hands. My main takeaway was: chill. The snack industry thrives on hype, inventing fake scarcity (“limited-edition mayo”) to trick us into thinking bread plus filling is suddenly revolutionary.

          Chaotic Bubbles
        </p>
        <p class="article">
          When most folks imagine bubbles, they picture childhood soap wands or champagne fizz. But those are simple, predictable bubbles—short-lived, delicate, gone in seconds. True bubble potential comes when they behave unpredictably: swerving mid-air, stacking in clusters, even vibrating when poked. In my lab, I tested bubbles that reacted to sound waves and—strangely—whistled back. Turns out, there’s a whole reactive world beyond the pop.
