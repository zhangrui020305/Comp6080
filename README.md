# Assessment 1 (HTML, CSS)

[Please see course website for full spec](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs6080/NOW/assessments/assignments/ass1)

This assignment is due Friday the 3rd of October, 8pm.

Please run `./util/setup.sh` in your terminal before you begin. This will set up some checks in relation to the "Git Commit Requirements".

## Your Task - PicToCode

### 1. Task 1 - Static, fixed size page

Build a page that looks identical to [task1/page.png](task1/page.png). The window width you should work with is 1500 x 1300 pixels. You are only allowed to use HTML and CSS for this task. No external libraries are permitted.

Please build your page in [task1/index.html](task1/index.html). You are welcome to create as many CSS files that you need in the `task1` folder for `index.html` to import. When being marked, your tutor will start with `index.html`.

On top of this you are required to:
 * Ensure that the *Go* button box has a hover opacity of `0.5`.
 * When your mouse hovers over any of the latest article names, the text should turn #0000FF.
 * When your mouse hovers over any of the navigation buttons, the text and border should turn #FFF.

#### Assets

- The asset(s) are provided in `task1/assets`.
- The font used on this page should match exactly. The font used is `Roboto` for the page.
- The right chevron on this page is the encoded character `&rsaquo;`.

### 2. Task 2 - Static, fixed size page

Build a page that looks identical to [task2/page.png](task2/page.png). The window width you should work with is 1490 x 1250 pixels. You are only allowed to use HTML and CSS for this task. No external libraries are permitted.

Please build your page in `task2/index.html`. You are welcome to create as many CSS files that you need in the `task2` folder for `index.html` to import. When being marked, your tutor will start with `index.html`.

On top of this you are required to:
* Ensure that hovering on any of the tab items *Accommodation*, *Holiday rentals*, *Flights*, *Car Hire*, and *Activities* has the green text and underline as shown on *Accommodation* in the image.

#### Assets

- The asset(s) are provided in `task2/assets`.
- The font used on this page should match exactly. The font used is `Arial` for the page.

### 3. Task 3 - Responsive, static page

Build a responsive page that complies with [task3/page_big.png](task3/page_big.png) and [task3/page_small.png](task3/page_small.png). The big page is 1270 x 1330 pixels, and the small page is 550 x 1330 pixels. Your single page (note that you're not using two separate HTML files) should look identical to either of these pages depending on the window size the browser is at.

You are expected to have reasonable intermediate states. In other words, if the window size is some combination of widths between 1270 and 550, combined with some height of 1330, the page should still reflect the same general structure.

Please build your page in `task3/index.html`. You are welcome to create as many CSS files that you need in the `task3` folder for `index.html` to import. When being marked, your tutor will start with `index.html`.

On top of this you are required to:
 * Ensure that the *Subscribe now* buttons invert on hover (e.g., the background and text colors swap), as shown in the middle button.

#### Assets

- The asset(s) are provided in `task3/assets`.
- The font used on this page should match exactly. The font used for main text is `sans-serif` and `Abril Titling SemiBold` for headings for the page.

# Assumptions

- Markers are aware that font rendering can vary between different browsers and operating systems. As long as you have used the correct font specified for the task and made a reasonable effort to match the intended design, we will not penalize minor typography inconsistencies and will show some leniency in this area.
